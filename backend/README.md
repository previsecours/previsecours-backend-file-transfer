```
git clone https://github.com/guillim/nodejs-API-starterkit.git node_API && cd node_API && npm install
```  

## Run:

## Advanced Configuration:
To get the database working, you need an extra step.
1. Go to https://mlab.com/ and create a free account (you have 500 Mo for free, enough for testing ! )
2. Create a database, and remember the name you chose 
3. Add a user and a password, and copy the "mongod" URL
4. In the /config folder, rename _db_example.js_ into _db.js_ and replace password, username and databasename by the one you just created
